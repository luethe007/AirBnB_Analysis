## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The following packages need to be installed:
- spacy
- gensim
- pyLDAvis 

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Munich AirBnB data to better understand:

1. If there were patterns in the price development?
2. What AirBnB guests in Munich care about?
3. What the most popular places in Munich are?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The file *airbnb_analysis.ipynb* contains the code for the whole project.
*lda.html* is the interactive LDA visualization. The heatmap for Munich can be
found in *my_gm_plot.html*. The remaining files are the source datasets and LDA gensim
files stored to load in the pre-trained model.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
